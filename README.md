# Natural-Language-Processing-Project
This is a Udemy project designed by Jose Portilla, Head of Data Science, Pierian Data Inc. and uses Yelp Review Dataset from Kaggle.

This project is based on classifying 1 to 5 star Yelp reviews according to their usefulness to anyone who is trying to gauge the quality of service provided at a restaurant or a hotel. Here exploratory data analysis and data visualization is initially done, to check the nature of given dataset. 
Then comes the part where natural language analysis is done. Feature and target labels are created, train test split is done and predictions are made.
